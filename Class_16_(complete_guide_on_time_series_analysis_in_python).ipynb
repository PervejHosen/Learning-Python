        "- **Cyclical Component** - These are the trends with no set repetition over a particular period of time. A cycle refers to the period of ups and downs, booms and slums of a time series, mostly observed in business cycles. These cycles do not exhibit a seasonal variation but generally occur over a time period of 3 to 12 years depending on the nature of the time series.\n",
        "\n",

        "- **Irregular Variation** - These are the fluctuations in the time series data which become evident when trend and cyclical variations are removed. These variations are unpredictable, erratic, and may or may not be random.\n",
